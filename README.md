# hello-world

Scripts that perform some simple tasks simulating some of
our very basic day-to-day activities, like sending a greeting
message to others before starting a conversation, or checking
out the date and time it is now.

## Greetings

This module will send a simple greeting message with your name
tagged along at the end, given your name.

It will send out the message "Hi there! -- FirstName LastName"

### Example

Calling `greetings("Clare")` will return `"Hi there! -- Clare"`

## Time

This module is used for checking out the current date and time.

It will return the current date and time in the format
"HH:MM MM/DD/YYYY".

### Example

Calling `time()` will return `"13:46 02/27/2024"`
