Scripts that perform some simple tasks simulating some of
our very basic day-to-day activities, like sending a greeting
message to others or checking out the current date and time.

### Greetings

This module will send a simple greeting message with your name
tagged along at the end, given your name.   
It will send out the message "Hi there! -- FirstName LastName"

##### Example

Calling `greetings("Clare")` will return `"Hi there! -- Clare"`

### Time

This module will inform you of the current date and time.   
It will return the current date and time in the format
"HH:MM MM/DD/YYYY".

##### Example

Calling `time()` will return `"13:46 02/27/2024"`
